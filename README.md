 Predict Wins Given Pre-10-Minute Data

Thank you to OraclesElixir for the data: https://oracleselixir.com/

A Reddit post briefly analyzing the data is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/11wug3h/what_pre10minute_stats_are_most_useful_in_wins/

There are things I would improve on for this project if I were to do it again. These include:
1. Tuning my models
2. Testing for outliers and removing them
3. Having more data points (either by not excluding major regions or waiting for more data to come out)
4. Stop using plt.savefig() in functions and put them in the for loop instead
5. Get more familiar with using figures instead of the standard plot.
